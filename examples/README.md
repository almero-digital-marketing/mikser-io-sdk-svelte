# Examples

This folder contains runnable examples that show how to use **`mikser-io-sdk-svelte`** end to end, from a running mikser backend to three different rendering strategies.

## Projects

| Project | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`mikser-content/`](./mikser-content/) | The shared mikser backend: documents, schemas, layouts, and lifecycle. Run this first. |
| [`pure-spa/`](./pure-spa/) | Runtime-everything Svelte 5 SPA. Routes, views, and live updates all resolved in the browser. |
| [`hybrid-ssg/`](./hybrid-ssg/) | SvelteKit project: static prerendered public side + a non-prerendered live editor SPA from one catalog. |
| [`islands/`](./islands/) | mikser owns the HTML; Svelte mounts into specific DOM nodes. |

## Prerequisites

- Node 18+
- A running mikser backend (see [`mikser-content/`](./mikser-content/)) on `http://localhost:3001`

## Run order

```bash
# 1. Start the mikser backend (shared content)
cd mikser-content
npm install
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, run any of the example apps
cd pure-spa      # or hybrid-ssg, or islands
npm install
npm run dev
```

For `hybrid-ssg`, the same `npm run dev` runs both the prerender-eligible public routes and the `/admin` SPA via the SvelteKit dev server. To produce the static build:

```bash
cd hybrid-ssg
npm run build      # static build (public side prerendered; /admin via fallback)
npm run preview    # preview the built site
```

## Environment

| Var | Used by | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_MIKSER_URL` | `pure-spa`, `islands` (Vite client bundle) | `http://localhost:3001` |
| `PUBLIC_MIKSER_URL` | `hybrid-ssg` browser side (SvelteKit `$env/static/public`) | `http://localhost:3001` |
| `MIKSER_URL` | `hybrid-ssg` build-time loaders | `http://localhost:3001` |

Each app is independent: its own `package.json`, its own build config, its own `README.md`.

## Notes

- The examples import from the local `mikser-io-sdk-svelte` package via `file:` deps, so changes to the SDK are reflected immediately.
- The shared content lives in `mikser-content/` and is consumed by all three apps.
